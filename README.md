# python-challenge - this cahllenge, tasked with createing Pythons scripts to analyze the rinancial reocrds of two datasets. 
# the two projects consist of PyPoll and PyBank

##PyBank
# The project script is in a CVS file
#Thre are financial dataset called budget_data.csv . that is coposed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses"

##Task - to create a Python scropt to analyze the records to calculate the following values: 
	# The total number of months included in the datset
	#The Net total amount of "Profit / Losses" over the entire period
	#The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes 
	#The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period 
	#The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

# Created a repository called Python challege
	# created two new folders called PyBank and PyPoll 
		# created new files called main.py - this will be the main script to run for each analysis 
		# create a folder called "resources" that contains the CSV fildes you used. 
		# create an analysis folder that contains your text files that has the results form your analysis 

#Import OS - 
#import CSV 

# as I had alot of trouble with my files I ended up getting help from the TA's. My files would not read with my code.  When talking to them them my code overall looked good a few changes with  the indentions. But code was still not reading the files.  Finally they helped by moving my folders outside of the other folder and using something  differnt other than subline.  We finally got it to work.  after finished coding we moved it over to Subline and it worked fine. (that is why you will see extra files in the file folders) 

#worked on coding and calculating the following values: 
  # found the total number of months
  # finding the net total aomount of 'profit/losses'
  #continue on with the increase and decrese in profits 



## PyBank. 
##PyBank
# The project script is in a CVS file
#Thre are financial dataset called elections.csv . that is coposed of three columns: "Voter ID" and "Country" and "Candidate"
##Task - to create a Python script to analyze the records to calculate the following values: 
	# The total number ofvotes cast
	# a complete list of candidates who recieve votes
	#a percentage of votes each candidate won
	#the total number of votes each candidate won
	3the winner of the election based on popular vote



# Created a repository called Python challege
	# created two new folders called PyBank and PyPoll 
		# created new files called main.py - this will be the main script to run for each analysis 
		# create a folder called "resources" that contains the CSV files you used. 
		# create an analysis folder that contains your text files that has the results form your analysis 

#Import OS - 
#import CSV 

# this time I tried programing and set folders up. Same issues so I reverted back to  just copied the code from the other file  	#and changed the csv files names.

 #worked on coding and calculating the following values: 
  # total number of votes cast
  #complete list of candidats who recieved votes
  #percentage of votes for each candidate won
  #the total nubmer of votes each candiate won
  #the winner of the election based on popular vote.
